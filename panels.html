    <title>Project Fire Flower panels</title>
    <p>
      The tactile panels on display here can be “seen” through touch. Each panel
      is 24” by 24” square and depicts a classic firework effect. The
      trajectories of the stars, which give fireworks their characteristic
      shapes, are illuminated in light against a black background. These
      trajectories are engraved as “pathways” that can be followed with a
      fingertip.
    </p>

    <p>
      The designs for the panels are based on realistic images of fireworks;
      each image depicts a single type of firework effect and its characteristic
      shape. These look somewhat like long-exposure photographs that reveal the
      movement of the stars as streaks of light. The star trajectories create
      the overall shapes of the fireworks as they blossom during their transient
      life spans.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my goals here is to present the effects with enough clarity that
      the viewer can begin to distinguish the different shell types through
      touch – just as if each panel was a unique type of flower.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the back wall of the gallery, a series of panels depict the appearance
      of a firework as if frozen in time at three points in its lifespan. This
      approach is used for the peony shell, which does not leave visible streaks
      behind the moving stars. Thus, the images on the panels are freeze-framed
      as the shell explodes and its stars move increasingly farther apart.
    </p>

    <h3>Chrysanthemum:</h3>

    <p>
      The chrysanthemum shell creates a spherical structure of light and is
      named after the chrysanthemum flower. At the zenith (top) of this shell’s
      ascent, an explosive “hard break” burst charge ejects hundreds of
      fast-moving stars outwards in all directions. These stars leave visible
      straight tracers (streaks) of light behind them, which appear to connect
      the moving stars to their centre burst point. The overall effect is like
      spikes of light radiating outwards creating a perfect sphere of shooting
      stars. The structure of this shell is similar to a dandelion flower which
      has gone to seed. When the sphere stops expanding, the stars may sparkle
      briefly before they suddenly disappear.
    </p>

    <h3>Comets:</h3>
    <p>
      Comets are stars featuring long thick tails of glittering or
      orange-coloured light streaming behind them as they travel. They may
      appear like slow-moving “shooting stars” with their trajectories revealed
      by their trails of light. Comet stars are used as a component in many
      shells, including chrysanthemum, dahlia, and willow shells to name a few.
      Comets may be launched in an array (group) featuring different firing
      angles for each shell– creating fingers of light spreading out in a
      fan-shaped (palmate pattern. When comets come from different locations so
      that their diagonal flight paths cross in the air, they appear to” weave”
      their strands of light into an interlaced criss-crossing lattice pattern.
    </p>

    <h3>Willow:</h3>

    This gorgeous firework shell creates the shape of a weeping willow tree. As
    the shell rises after launch, it leaves a thick trail of sparks which show
    the “trunk” of the tree. When the shell reaches its desired altitude, it
    bursts open gently into dozens of comet-like stars. These arc outwards like
    the curved spines of an open umbrella. The stars leave long trails of
    orange-coloured light, creating the vine-like branches of the weeping willow
    tree. A charcoal composite is used to create the long-burning stars which
    stay visible as they slowly descend.

    <h3>Dahlia:</h3>

    The dahlia shell features large bright stars with visible tracers of light.
    Like the chrysanthemum, the structure of the effect is created by radiating
    spikes of light coming from a centre burst point. However, the dahlia
    features larger (and fewer) stars compared to the chrysanthemum and peony
    shells. Thus, it may not appear to be spherical. The dahlia’s long and
    bright spikes of light may seem more like a many-pointed sea star or a
    blossom with long lush petals. The effect can be dazzling when rendered in
    white light.

    <h3>Palm:</h3>

    The palm shell is named after the classic coconut palm tree. This shell
    ascends with a thick “rising tail” of light behind it – creating the
    appearance of a palm tree trunk. Sometimes, the shell rotates while rising-
    creating a twisting tail in a helix (corkscrew) pattern of light on its way
    up. At the desired altitude, the shell breaks and ejects several brilliant
    large palm tree fronds which complete the appearance of the entire tree.
    These palm shells may also appear as a cluster of several trees growing at
    different angles from a central launch point.

    <h3>Shell of shells:</h3>
    <p>
      This complex firework shell has more than one phase in its life-span –
      creating a sequence of movements over time. A shell of shells is a
      compound (multi-break) fireworks effect which can take many forms. One of
      these opens gently with a “soft-break” at its apex and emits dozens of
      brilliant comet stars with visible tails of shimmering light. The arching
      trails of light look like curving blades of grass. These falling stars
      then burst open again, giving birth to more clusters of comet stars. The
      structure is like a spider plant with smaller “spiders” emerging from the
      descending vines of the “parent” plant.
    </p>

    <h3>Peony:</h3>
    <p>
      The peony is a spherical aerial firework featuring hundreds of stars. The
      shell bursts in air with an explosive “hard-break” ejecting its stars in
      all directions. These ball stars move outwards without leaving any streaks
      or tracers of light behind them. This creates a rapidly expanding ball of
      light with the stars covering the surface. Like the chrysanthemum shell,
      the peony stars also radiate in all directions simultaneously: some moving
      toward you, some moving to the sides, and some moving away from you. The
      growth of the peony blossom over time can be shown in a sequence of
      “snapshots” each of which shows how the stars spread out as the peony
      expands.
